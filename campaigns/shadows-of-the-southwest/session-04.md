# Session 04 — Château Malchance (Parravon)

Purpose: Cross into Bretonnia, brave the perfumed bog around Château Malchance, and resolve the Dowager’s curse with a practice waltz, mirror duel, or chapel rite—setting the table for the grand ball in Session 05.

Session length: 3–4 hours

Structure: Three parts
- Part I — Crossing and Approach (Border → Perfumed Bog)
- Part II — Arrival and Exploration (Château Malchance)
- Part III — Finale (Practice Waltz or Chapel Rite; Margot’s Judgment)

---

## Part I — Crossing and Approach

1) Border Reprise (Parravon Gate of Perfumes)
- Setting: A Bretonnian gatehouse where visitors are sniffed (literally) for “perfumed corruption.” A perfumers’ guild agent stands beside a chaplain of the Lady.
- Play: Choose decorum (Etiquette/Charm), bribery (Trade/Bribery), or righteousness (display Morr token) to pass. Bring Eau de Morr and the inspector’s hawk sneezes (a clue and a laugh).
- Outcome: Visa stamp or stigma; +1 Heat with Traditionalists if you flaunt Orc tokens.

2) Road to Malchance — Perfumed Bog
- Setting: Sinking road through willow groves; faint scent of lilies over grave-water.
- Obstacles: Cart mire checks; leech swarms that react to perfume; raven markers point the right path.
- Checks: Endurance (mire), Perception (raven markers), Lore (Religion) to read waystones of Morr.

3) Optional: Escort of Bones
- A skeletal footman carrying a lantern appears and bows, “This way, honored late-arrivals.” Following grants advantage on navigation; refusing triggers a hazard.

## Part II — Arrival and Exploration (Château Malchance)

Atmosphere: Roses over rot; a ballroom humming with unheard strings; wardrobes breathing faintly when unopened; mirrors that blink a heartbeat late.

Key Spaces and Interactions

1) The Mirror Hall (Puzzle/Exploration)
- Effect: Reflections are delayed. Shadow actions act on a 1-round delay. Clever timing lets PCs bait or flank their own reflections.
- Clue: A cracked hand-mirror whispers “Not yet” to one PC, then laughs softly.

2) Wardrobes of Luck (Loot/Complication)
- Find: Masks, gloves, and tokens tied to specific ancestors. Wearing a token grants a small boon (+10 on one test) and a matching quirk (roleplay cost) until sunset.
- Consequence: Taking too many invites a reflected double (mirror spirit) to claim its due during the finale.

3) The Practice Ballroom (Social Duel by Waltz)
- Procedure: Three dances; each requires a lead, a follow, and vow-phrases spoken in etiquette. Failures invite spectral slaps (nonlethal, but humiliating) and reduce favor with Margot.
- Boons: Proper compliments to the skeletal major-domo and footmen grant +10 once.

4) Chapel of the Wrong God (Rite)
- Truth: The chapel was mis-consecrated to Morr. It binds Margot as much as it sustains her.
- Choices: Sanctify to Morr (release or weaken Margot), redirect to the Lady’s shadow (empower Margot with a price), or dismantle relics (anger both clergy; free the trapped wills to wander the estate).

5) Ossuary Below (Optional)
- Crawlspace beneath the chapel with a whispering reliquary that remembers vows and perfumes. A good place to stash/anchor items or retrieve echoes.

## Part III — Finale (Choose Your Stage)

Pick one primary resolution path; the others can still factor in as assists.

Path A — The Practice Waltz (Social/Puzzle)
- Run three set-piece dances. Each success secures a pledge from Margot’s household; each failure gives her leverage.
- Triumph: You may lay Margot to rest with a courtly benediction (Morr token helps) or bind her to appear as ally at the grand ball.

Path B — Mirror Duel (Skirmish/Timing)
- Fight your reflections through the delayed Mirror Hall. Actions “echo” on the next round. Shattering the correct mirror calls “the one who laughs at mirrors” to observe—or intervene.
- Triumph: Break the reflection’s hold; win a Mirror Shard Boon for Session 05 (cancel one reflection-based attack).

Path C — Chapel Rite (Ritual)
- With incense and vows, sanctify the chapel to Morr or redirect it. The reliquary hums; the ossuary speaks your names.
- Triumph: Either free Margot and gain her gratitude, or empower her and secure the estate’s protection in the coming ball. Failure risks a localized miscast (fear/test penalties until sunrise).

## Key NPCs (Spotlight)

Margot “The Dowager of Dust”
- Portrayal: Cutting wit, impeccable manners, grief worn like jewelry.
- Wants: The family preserved—dead or alive. Proper etiquette above all.
- Bargains: Truth in exchange for a vow; support at the ball for a dance done right.

Skeletal Major-Domo (New)
- Portrayal: Polite, exacting, enforces rules of the ballroom; announces you by mispronouncing your names charmingly.
- Offer: A discreet hint about the chapel’s vow-lines if shown respect.

Abbé Celestin (Return, Optional)
- Role: Crashes the scene with Traditionalists to purge the scandal, providing social pressure or a foil.

---

## Revelations
- The chapel’s mis-consecration chains Margot; its correction can free or redefine her.
- Breaking the correct mirror invites the attention of “the one who laughs at mirrors.”
- Wardrobe tokens echo specific ancestors and can be bartered for favors at the grand ball.

---

## Outcomes & Branches
- Lay Margot to Rest: Gain a Morr-blessed favor for Session 05; the estate quiets; fewer reflection hazards at the ball.
- Bargain with Margot: She attends the ball as an ally; gain +1 on social sway vs. Traditionalists; Orc pilgrims whisper of “a queen of bones who dances.”
- Empower Margot: Estate protects you in transit; Traditionalists gain Heat on the party; reflections grow bolder in Session 05 but you gain strong house boons.

---

## Rewards
- Mirror Shard Boon (once): Cancel a reflection-based penalty/attack in Session 05.
- Vow-Token: Spend to auto-succeed one etiquette line during the grand ball.
- Chapel Reliquary Ash: Sprinkle to sanctify a small space for one scene (fear/corruption checks at advantage).

---

## Handouts & Props (optional)
- Invitation to “Practice Waltz” with marginalia in old Bretonnian.
- Gate Visa bearing a hawk sigil scented faintly of lilies.
- Sketch of vow-lines crisscrossing the chapel floor.
