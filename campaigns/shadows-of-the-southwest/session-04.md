# Session 04 — Château Malchance (Parravon)

## Goal
Lay or leverage the Dowager Margot; unravel the mirror curse and anchor objects.

## Opening
- Enter the half-sunken estate; perfumes of rot and roses. Invitations to a practice waltz drift in on a wind.

## Key Scenes
1) Exploration: Mirror Hall shows delayed reflections; wardrobes hide luck tokens.
2) Puzzle/Exorcism: Dance steps as ritual movements; vows spoken in etiquette bind the dead.
3) Confrontation: Margot appears with courtly scorn; skeletal servants insist on perfect manners.

## Combat/Challenge Options
- Social duel by waltz; each misstep invites a spectral strike.
- Mirror duel vs. your reflection; those without reflections move freely.

## Revelations
- The chapel was mis-consecrated to Morr; sanctifying it frees or empowers Margot.
- Breaking the right mirror calls “the one who laughs at mirrors.”

## Milestone
Choose: put Margot to rest, bargain for lineage secrets, or bind her as an ally for the ball.
