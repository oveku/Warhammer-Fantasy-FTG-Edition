A Warhammer Fantasy FTG Edition campaign that begins in the Empire and draws the heroes toward Bretonnia, into the cursed legacy of House Le Satanreux of Parravon.

- Tone: Grimdark investigation, occult inheritance, political intrigue

## Campaign Premise
A patron in the Empire requests the heroes travel to Bretonnia (Parravon) to investigate the decaying fortunes of House Le Satanreux and prevent their curse from spilling across borders. Rumors speak of haunted vineyards, luck-forged coins, and an undead matriarch hosting balls for the dead.

## How to Start
- Present 1–2 hooks from hooks.md in Altdorf or Nuln
- Tie at least one PC to the Satanreux bloodline or debts
- Promise wealth, titles, or absolution from Bretonnian authorities in exchange for service

## Using This Campaign with FTG House Rules
- Social Combat: Political salons and ecclesiastical hearings matter; plan set-piece debates
- Corruption: Necromancy and cursed objects tempt PCs—track consequences
- Travel: Use encounters that test grit, luck, and reputation across borders

Happy haunting. May luck favor the damned.
