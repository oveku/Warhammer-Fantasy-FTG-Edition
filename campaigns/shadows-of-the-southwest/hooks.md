# Adventure Hooks — Shadows of the Southwest

These hooks are aligned with Sessions 01–05 and keep the campaign in sync. Each lists setup, complications, outcomes, and which session(s) it flows into.

---

## [S01] Quiet Commission to Bretonnia (Witch Hunter Briefing)
- Setup: Witch Hunter Captain Hildegard Falk offers letters of passage, a purse, and a mandate to quietly resolve the Satanreux scandal.
- Complications: A rival Witch Hunter cell wants a public purge; the Candle Vault’s candle labeled “Satanreux — Third Death” won’t stay out.
- Outcomes: Accept for official visas and a Morr token; refuse and rely on forgeries or bribes (adds Heat). Leads to Brücke-Watch Waystation.
- Leads to: Session 01 (border confrontation), Locations: Candle Vault, Brücke-Watch.

## [S01] The Street Whisper (Apothecary Incident)
- Setup: At Maison Satanreux Apothecary, a buyer of Eau de Morr whispers “Not yet” and collapses. The ledger overlays an older spell; a receipt points to Stir Dock 3.
- Complications: Mariette Voss bargains for the party’s protection on a perfume run; Witch Hunters sniff around.
- Outcomes: Gain a vial (one-use boon/temptation) or a delivery chit that leads to Eléonore’s bone barge.
- Leads to: Session 01 → Session 03 (Perfumes & Prophecies), Locations: Apothecary, River Stir barge.

## [S01 Optional] The Green Pilgrimage
- Setup: Orc pilgrims demand a sign from “Da Burnt Prophet.”
- Complications: Loud “escort” angers Bretonnian officials; friendly brawl if mishandled.

## [S02] The Lucky Midnight (Golden Pike, Nuln)
- Setup: Artois’ den, Sir Arto Brett’s Golden Pike, runs on a midnight rule: luck tilts until the bell tolls—only inside the Pike.
- Complications: Witch Hunter widows haunt the tables; the backroom ledger is Robert’s overwritten spellbook; bravos duel by custom (nonlethal until humiliated).
- Outcomes: Win/steal/neutralize the Lucky Coin; earn or lose Artois as a contact; secure letters of passage via favors.
- Leads to: Session 02; Locations: Nuln waterfront; Encounter: Midnight on the Nuln Docks.

## [S03] Perfumes and Prophecies (Eléonore’s Barge)
- Setup: Follow Stir Dock 3 deliveries to a bone-barge where Eléonore preaches the Lady’s “shadow aspect.”

- Outcomes: Claim/consecrate/destroy the portable perfume still (anchor); earn cryptic blessing or enmity.
- Leads to: Session 03; Locations: River Stir bone barge; Encounter: Perfume Run.

## [S04] The Dowager of Dust (Château Malchance)
- Setup: A perfumed invitation arrives: “Celebrate Robert’s third death.” The château’s ballroom hosts a spectral waltz.
- Complications: Etiquette is law; mirror hall reflects delayed actions; chapel was mis-consecrated to Morr.
- Outcomes: Lay Margot to rest, bargain for lineage secrets, or bind her as an ally for the grand ball.
- Leads to: Session 04; Locations: Château Malchance; Encounter: The Waltzing Dead Cart.

## [S05] The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Grand Ball)
- Setup: Mortals and ghosts mingle under truce; factions of the Lady and Morr circle; Orc pilgrims wait outside for a sign.
- Complications: Three dances mirror Robert’s three deaths; reflections attack when anchors resonate (coin, perfume, reliquary).
- Outcomes: Redemption (sanctify), Damnation (weaponize luck), or Masked Regent (bind the curse). Fate of Bretonnia’s scandal sealed.
- Leads to: Session 05; Locations: Château Malchance; payoffs for all anchors.
