# Session 01 — The Call to Bretonnia

## Goal
Engage the party with 1–2 hooks that require travel to Parravon, secure papers, and survive the road.

## Opening Scene (Choose One)
1) Altdorf Apothecary: Eléonore’s agents sell “Eau de Morr.” A buyer collapses, whispering, “Not yet.”  
2) Nuln Gambling Den: Artois’ coin flips favors; midnight approaches and so do Witch Hunters.  
3) Witch Hunter Briefing: A stern patron offers absolution/titles for a quiet Bretonnian cleanup.

## Encounters
- Social: Secure letters of passage; debate a Bretonnian chaplain about “shadow aspects.”
- Exploration: Choose the safe road (taxes and tests) or the hollow way (omens and shortcuts).
- Combat: Ambush by bandits hired to steal a particular mirror; they will not look into it.

## Revelations
- Coin, perfume, and mirrors repeat; ravens croak “Not yet.”
- A mis-consecrated chapel to Morr binds the Dowager.
- Parravon’s vintners and chaplains feud behind fans and falcons.

## Milestone
Cross the border with either official sanction or clever deceit; earn a rival and an ally.

## Rewards
- Letters of passage; a token blessed by Morr (once per session reroll against fear or corruption);
- A rumor: “Where the wine tastes like memory, the dead dance politely.”
