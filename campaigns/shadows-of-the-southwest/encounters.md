## [S01] Mirror Bandits (Roadside Combat)
- Where: Misty hedgerow lane or forest switchback near the border
- Tone: Skittish violence; everyone avoids reflections

### Setup
Kaspar “Rotgut” Kessel and his crew block the road with a toppled cart and smoke pots. They demand “tax” on mirrors and mirrored things. They refuse to look into any reflective surface.

### Environment & Tactics
- Smoke reduces visibility; Perception checks to spot flanking slingers.
- Kaspar wears cloth over his eyes in melee, guided by a bell. If anyone forces him to see a reflection, he panics and flees.
- The bandits aim to snatch, not slay. They disengage at 50% losses.

### Alternatives to Combat
- Bribe: Pay in coin or surrender a mundane mirror to pass.
- Intimidate: Display holy symbols or Orc tokens to make them scatter.
- Trick: Cover your mirrors in ash to “spoil” them (Opposed Int vs. Intuition).

### Clues & Loot
- Eau de Morr stopper with falcon crest (Vintners tie).
- Hand-sketched map leading to Stir Dock 3 (Eléonore’s route).
- Pouch of mirror-polish that causes a 1-second reflection delay when applied.

### Consequences
- If you kill needlessly, Valoise hears; −1 with Border Officials.
- If you capture Kaspar, he names his employer as a “guildman with a falcon pin.”

## [S01] Zealot Procession (Social/Threat)
- Where: Border road or Parravon square
- Tone: Pious pressure

### Setup
Traditionalist zealots parade a cracked pilgrimage mirror demanding foreigners “show true faces.”

### Play
- Social Combat against the leader; each victory prevents stigma marks.
- Trick: Powder the mirror so it shows nothing; pass as “pure by cloud.”

### Outcomes
- Win: Avoid stigma and gain a sympathetic onlooker contact.
- Lose: Suffer a stigma that hinders dealings with the Lady’s clergy but impresses a hidden Morr priest.

## [S01][S04] Ossuary Echo (Exploration/Puzzle)
- Where: Wayside mausoleum on the Parravon road
- Tone: Whispered sermons and mirror chills

### Setup
Inside, a preserved echo of a sermon repeats when the door is shut. Each repetition grows clearer until it mentions “anchors: coin, scent, mirror.”

### Puzzle
- Time the door opens with the final word to capture the echo in a bottle (Dex/Int test combo).

### Reward
- Bottled Echo (single-use): Gain advantage on one roll to identify or disrupt an anchor.

## [S01 Optional] The Green Pilgrimage (Fun Orc Encounter)
- Where: Border Waystation or country road near Parravon
- Tone: Chaotic comedic reverence with real danger if disrespected

### Setup
A chanting line of Orcs and Goblins marches under banners painted with a half-melted human face crowned by a cooking pot. They carry offerings: burnt bacon, cracked mirrors, and candles stuck in helmets. They seek “Da Burnt Prophet” and think the party are his heralds.

### Atmosphere & Details
- Drums from pots and shields; bacon smoke mixes with incense snatched from humans.
- The lead Black Orc, Mogdrak Skullgleam, polishes a shield to use as a “seer glass.”
- Goblin attendants juggle candles and drop wax sigils (sometimes a tear-shape).

### What Orcs Want
- A sign from the Prophet (any omen involving fire, mirrors, or coin flips)
- To “escort” the party safely (and loudly) to the nearest shrine
- To trade: bacon for stories of the Prophet’s miracles

### Skill Challenges (pick 2)
- Intimidate or Command to keep order in the mob (failure causes a friendly brawl)
- Lore (Religion) or Charm to reinterpret the Prophet’s omens toward the party’s goals
- Sleight of Hand to rig a prophetic coin flip without being caught

### Clues that Robert “Le Deux” Lives
- An Orc presents a charred scrap of a Grey Order robe with fresh ash (recent campfire smell)
- A Goblin minstrel hums a refrain that matches Luc le Rôdeur’s tune (nosebleeds ensue)
- A Black Orc shows a polished shield: a human face flickers in the reflection and mouths “Not yet” (only to one PC)

### Outcomes
- Success: Orcs become noisy escorts; reduce random encounters; gain an Orc token (once/session reroll on fear/intimidate vs. Orcs)
- Mixed: Orcs “help” by starting fights with people you needed to impress; gain heat in Parravon
- Failure: A skirmish breaks out (nonlethal unless escalated); still leave a chant: “’E lives, ‘e burns, ‘e laughs at mirrors!”

### Boons & Complications
- Boon: Green Mirror Shard — once per session, cancel a reflection-based penalty; nobles dislike it (−10 to Etiquette with Traditionalists while visible).
- Complication: Rumor spreads that the party are the Prophet’s agents; +1 Heat with Parravon Traditionalists, −1 Heat with Orcs.

## [S04] Falconer’s Trial (Social/Skill)
- Where: Parravon’s clifftop eyrie and flooded archives below
- Tone: Courtly test of wit and steadiness

### Setup
The Master Falconer tests foreigners with three proofs: Wind, Reflection, and Mercy. Passing earns a letter granting access to the flooded archives and audience with a guild taster.

### Three Proofs (choose two)
1) Riddle of the Wind: Solve a hawk-themed riddle (Intelligence/Lore: Nature). Failure summons a sudden gust—Agility test to keep footing.
2) Trial of Reflection: Gaze into a polished shield while answering questions of honor (Cool/Willpower). Satanreux-touched PCs see a delayed blink.
3) Mercy of the Talon: Handle an injured hawk or shoot a dangling ribbon without harming the bird (Animal Handling or Ballistic Skill at penalty).

### Outcomes
- Pass two: Gain Letter of Eyrie — advantage to research in archives; rumor of a chapel to Morr mis-consecrated at Château Malchance.
- Pass one: Gain a contact but not the letter; a guild taster will meet you later for a bribe.
- Fail all: You are mocked; +1 Heat with Parravon Traditionalists, but a Morr priest quietly offers sympathy and a clue about “perfumed luck.”

### Archive Clues
- Bone wine ledger entries referencing “Reserve: souls aged to bouquet.”
- Mirror repairs billed to “Château M.”
- Note: “Coin must toll midnight within Pike walls” (points to Nuln den).

## Midnight on the Nuln Docks (Foreshadow Artois)
- Where: Nuln waterfront, outside Sir Arto Brett’s Golden Pike
- Tone: Noir bustle, bells toll, luck turns on the hour

### Setup

### Play

- Skill: Catch the coin in midair at the stroke (Dex test) to feel a pulse of cold memory.

### Clues & Outcomes
- Clue: “Only inside the Pike does the midnight hold.”

---

## [S01→S03] Perfume Run (Chase/Heist)
- Where: Altdorf streets to Stir riverside dock
- Tone: Scented intrigue and moral ambiguity

### Setup
Mariette Voss moves a crate of Eau de Morr labeled “Lot Ysabeau” to Stir Dock 3. Rivals aim to steal it. Will the PCs protect, steal, or sabotage?

### Options
- Protect: Fight off thieves; gain Mariette’s favor and a vial.
- Steal: Swap crates; risk Witch Hunter attention.
- Sabotage: Salt the perfume with holy water; it blooms into white smoke that whispers “Not yet.”

### Clues & Rewards
- Delivery chit naming a ferryman known to Eléonore.
- Vial of Eau de Morr (one-use: revive a flower/corpse for one sentence; risk 1 Corruption).

## [S04→S05] The Waltzing Dead Cart (Roadside Mystery)
- Where: Country lane at dusk
- Tone: Melancholic, eerie politeness

### Setup
A covered cart creaks by itself, tea cups clinking within. Skeletal servants politely ask for directions to “the ball.”

### Play
- Social: Engage in etiquette; incorrect manners cause cups to rattle ominously.
- Skill: Evaluate to notice the tea is grave water; Lore (Religion) to sanctify it.

### Clues & Outcomes
- Clue: Invitation to “celebrate a third death” signed with an M in dust.
- Outcome: Earn a favor from the Dowager’s servants for correct etiquette (one reroll during Session 05 waltz).

## [S02] Golden Pike Floor Events (Social/Skill)

### Table Events (roll or choose 2–3)
1) Widow’s Hand: Help a Witch Hunter widow win a decisive hand at 11:59; gain her key if successful.
2) Clap Pattern: Croupiers clap a pattern; Int test deciphers it as the bell countdown.
3) The Tilt: At 11:50, the house gains a subtle edge (−10 to player luck rolls vs. house); at XII, one reroll flips that edge.
4) The Spill: A drink splashes into a perfect teardrop shape; omen of “Not yet.”

### Outcomes
- Earn parley with Artois, a private table, or suspicion from the Master of Midnight.

---

## [S02] Bravos’ Code Duel (Nonlethal Set Piece)
- Where: Pike’s dueling strip
- Tone: Flashy blades, crowd roars, honor over harm

### Rules
- First to three flourishes (showy hits that draw thread, not blood) wins.
- Dirty tricks reduce crowd favor; use Perform/Weapon Skill with style.

### Twists
- Mirror shard on floor shows delayed moves; clever PCs exploit timing.
- Sarto accepts a private buyout to throw the last flourish.

---

### Reward
- Ledger Page: single-use advantage to identify/disrupt anchor effects.

---

## [S02] Bell Jam Gambit (Sabotage)
- Where: Rafters crawlspace
- Tone: Dusty tension

### Play
- Jam the rope to delay the toll (Dex/Mechanics). On success, the coin overheats; reflections giggle “Not yet.” Fear checks nearby.

### Consequences

---

## [S02] Side Door Stakeout (Social/Stealth)
- Where: Nuln alley outside the Pike
- Tone: Noir hush
