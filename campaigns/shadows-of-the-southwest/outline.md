# Campaign Outline — Shadows of the Southwest

A border-crossing mystery from Altdorf to Parravon, descending into the cursed legacy of House Le Satanreux.

## Five-Evening Session Plan (Overview)
1) Session 01 — The Call to Bretonnia (Empire): Hooks, papers, and omens; optional Orc pilgrim encounter foreshadowing Le Deux.
2) Session 02 — The Lucky Midnight (Nuln): Confront Artois in his gambling den; win/lose the coin; first family clash.
3) Session 03 — Perfumes and Prophecies (River Stir): Track Eléonore’s bone barge or cult; debate, then duel/social-combat.
4) Session 04 — Château Malchance (Parravon): Face Margot in the haunted château; exorcism puzzle and mirror duel.
  - Travel: Cross the Paravvon Gate (perfumers + clergy), traverse perfumed bog hazards
  - Arrival: Explore Mirror Hall (delayed reflections), Wardrobes of Luck, Chapel of the Wrong God
  - Finale: Choose Practice Waltz (social/puzzle), Mirror Duel (timing skirmish), or Chapel Rite (ritual)
5) Session 05 — The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Parravon): Grand ball set-piece; meet Robert “Le Deux”; fate of Bretonnia at stake.

## Act I — The Call to Bretonnia (Empire → Parravon)
- Inciting Request: A patron (witch hunter, noble factor, or Grey Order mentor) tasks the party with investigating the Satanreux line in Bretonnia. Payment in titles, absolution, or rare tomes.
- Present 1–2 hooks from hooks.md (Bone Wine or Lucky Coin work best for travel impetus).
- Obstacles:
  - Bureaucracy: Border writs, letters of passage, and accusations of heresy.
  - Travel Perils: Banditry, Beastmen spoor, and an omen of ravens cawing “Not yet.”
  - Moral Choice: Aid a Bretonnian pilgrim caravan or take a shorter, cursed route.
- Milestone: Secure entry to Parravon and an audience with minor authorities or a suspicious chaplain of the Lady.

## Act II — Parravon’s Perfumes and Ghosts
- Investigations split between vintners’ guilds, shrines to the Lady, and ruined Satanreux lands.
- Revelations:
  - Luck is manufactured: tokens, corpse-derived perfumes, and coins imbued with bound spirits.
  - The family’s chapel was accidentally consecrated to Morr; funerary rites misdirected souls to Château Malchance.
  - Eléonore’s “shadow aspect” draws Morr’s attention; she distills memory from the dead and calls it sacrament.
- Set Pieces:
  - The Dowager’s Waltz: a spectral ball at Château Malchance (social combat + exorcism puzzle).
  - The Bone Wine tasting: nobles risk their souls for bouquet and status.
  - River Stir Barge: doctrine debate, reliquary heist, or sanctification; optional river chase.
- Milestone: Identify the anchor objects (coin, perfume still, chapel reliquary) and choose which to destroy, redeem, or repurpose.

## Act III — Luck’s Price
- Antagonists converge: Orc pilgrims of “Da Burnt Prophet,” Parravon zealots, and guild enforcers.
- Choices reshape the curse:
  - Sanctify the chapel to Morr, or embrace the Lady’s shadow aspect.
  - Bargain with Margot (power for a promise) or lay her to rest.
  - Decide Robert II’s fate: martyr, monster, or masked regent.
- Set Piece: Mirror War echoes — a hall of mirrors where reflections attack; only those without reflections can pass freely.
- Milestone: Cure, contain, or weaponize the Satanreux luck.

## Epilogue — Masks and Mirrors
- Rewards depend on choices: titles in Parravon, enmity of the Lady’s clergy, or a Morr-blessed sanctuary.
- Ongoing Threads: Wardens of the Hollow, Black Orc pilgrimages, and a minstrel whose songs cause nosebleeds.

## Factions and Fronts
- The Cult of Eau de Morr (Eléonore’s apothecary front): profit from luck perfumes.
- Parravon Court Traditionalists: purge heresy, hide noble scandals.
- Orc Pilgrims of the Burnt Prophet: “escort” destiny.
- Guild of Vintners and Tasters: bone wine, bribery, and blackmail.

## Session Pacing
- 4–5 sessions total for this mini-arc; each session includes 1 key confrontation.
- Rotate encounter types: investigation → social → exploration → combat.
- Use fail-forward: wrong choices reveal truths at a price (corruption, scars, obligations).
