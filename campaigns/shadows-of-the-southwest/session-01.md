# Session 01 — The Call to Bretonnia

Purpose: Launch the campaign, seed core motifs (coin, perfume, mirrors, “Not yet”), and send the party from the Empire toward Parravon with papers, allies, and a looming sense of cursed inheritance.

Session length: 3–4 hours

Primary beats:
- Hook in Altdorf (or briefing) → investigation and prep → road perils (Empire-side) → Ending up in Nuln.

---

## Deep Background (for the GM)

- House Le Satanreux exported “luck” into the Empire through an apothecary front selling Eau de Morr (a perfume laced with ancestor-scent). Eléonore’s agents believe the Lady has a “shadow aspect” that legitimizes their rites; Morr’s clergy believes errant funerary magic is misdirecting souls toward Château Malchance.
- Traditionalists in Parravon fear scandal and want a quiet purge. Witch Hunters in Altdorf want leverage: shut down the cross-border heresy without igniting a diplomatic incident.
- Orc pilgrims from the Drakwald carry rumors of a Burnt Prophet who laughs at mirrors. They converge on border roads hoping for a sign.

Core truth to reveal gradually: The Satanreux “manufacture” luck by binding it to anchors (coin, perfume still, reliquary/mirrors). Each anchor tugs at Robert Le Satanreux II across death and reflection.

## Locations (expanded backstories)

1) Altdorf — Maison Satanreux Apothecary (Front)
- History: Once a reputable spice house, purchased cheaply after its owners vanished during a winter plague. Eléonore’s cult retrofitted a cellar into a micro-ossuary still.
- Layout & Atmosphere: Bell over the door chimes out of rhythm; dried bouquets hang from rafters; faint mirror set behind the counter always a half-breath slow.
- Features: Ledger written over an older spell—ink shades different under moonlight; trapdoor to a cool cellar with ribbed shelves of vials; raven roost in the chimney cap.
- Secrets & Clues:
	- Vial stamped with a falcon sigil (Parravon vintners’ guild)—points to court influence.
	- Mirror smudges form the letters N—U— (Nuln) when breathed upon at midnight.
	- Receipt for “perfume glass” ordered to a riverside dock on the Stir (points to Eléonore’s barge).

2) Altdorf — The Candle Vault (Witch Hunter Briefing House)
- History: Safehouse used for quiet operations against cults; candles labeled with case names.
- Atmosphere: Beeswax, iron, and stale parchment; floorboards that don’t creak in certain paths.
- Features: Lockbox with pre-signed letters of passage; a Morr token in a velvet pouch.
- Secrets: One candle is labeled “Satanreux — Third Death.” It refuses to stay extinguished.

4) The Hollow Way (Optional Shortcut)
- History: Old funeral path; tree canopies knit overhead; ravens perch in precise intervals.
- Effect: Cuts half a day but invites omens and reflection anomalies; low-level corruption checks on failed Willpower.
- Sign: A cracked hand-mirror wedged in a stump whispers “Not yet” in a PC’s voice.

## Opening Scenes (choose one or blend)

1) Apothecary Incident (Investigation + Social)
- Event: A well-heeled buyer samples Eau de Morr, goes glassy-eyed, and whispers “Not yet.”
- Beats:
	- Calm the crowd (Leadership/Charm, Average).
	- Inspect the vial (Lore: Magic or Medicine, Average → learn “ancestor-scent”).
	- Spot the ledger overlay (Perception, Easy → find Stir dock order; follow-up Inquiry, Average).
	- Mariette bargains: aid her shipment in return for information; she hints of a “midnight coin.”

2) Witch Hunter Briefing (Social)
- Offer: Letters of passage, minor absolution, expense purse.
- Conditions: Keep it quiet; return anchors for evidence or provide proof of destruction.
- Complication: Another cell wants a public purge; they may become rivals later.

3) The Street Whisper (Quick Hook)
- A raven drops an invitation scrap: “Celebrate Robert’s third death.” Address smudged with wine.
- Leads to either the Apothecary or Brücke-Watch (see Session 03) depending on player choice.

---

## Road Perils (run 1–2)

1) Mirror Bandits (Combat/Intimidation)
- Goal: Steal mirrors or mirrored objects.
- Tactics: Smoke pots; do not look into reflective surfaces.
- Clues on Capture: Coin rumor; Eau de Morr stopper with falcon crest.

2) Green Pilgrimage Cameo (Fun Social)
- See encounters.md (“The Green Pilgrimage”). Use if players need a hopeful omen or loud escort.

3) Beastmen Spore (Atmospheric)
- No fight unless provoked; ravens peck tracks into the shape of a tear.

---

## Clue Trail (what Session 01 should deliver)

- Coin Motif → Nuln den at midnight (Artois).
- Perfume Motif → Stir dock orders (Eléonore’s barge).
- Mirror Motif → Brücke-Watch tests and delayed reflections (Session 03; Château Malchance).
- Raven/“Not yet” Motif → Robert’s continued influence; Orc pilgrims seeking signs.

---

## Outcomes & Branches

- Best Case: Ally in Falk, solid clues to coin and barge. Reputation: +1 with pragmatic officials, 0 with Traditionalists.
- Mixed Case: Forged papers work but flag PCs (Heat +1). Gain a rival in the zealot faction. Orcs might trail you as “heralds.”
- Worst Case: Mirror bandits escalate or a rite goes awry; take the Hollow Way (gain 1 temporary Corruption if you fail a Hard Willpower test) but reach Nuln with spooky proof that “something watches.”
- Optional: If PCs steal the wrong mirror, the reflection pursues one character in dreams (advantage once / penalty once next session; GM’s choice depending on play).

---

## Rewards

- Letters of Passage (advantage on future customs checks once).
- Token of Morr (once per session reroll vs. fear/corruption).
- Favor from Falk (banked; spend to cancel one bureaucratic obstacle later).
- If allied with Orcs: Orc Token (advantage on tests to influence Orcs; disadvantage with stuffy nobles if displayed).

## Handouts & Props (optional)

- Invitation Scrap: “Celebrate Robert’s third death — dress to reflect.”

## GM Notes & Pacing

- Spotlight balance: Give each PC a scene to use their best approach (face for customs, scout for Hollow Way, scholar for perfume/mirror lore).
- Fail Forward: Even failed checks produce clues at a cost (heat, stigma, minor corruption, a rival).
- Tone: Grim but not hopeless; let odd humor breathe through Orc pilgrims and bureaucratic absurdity.

---

## Next: Session 02 — The Lucky Midnight (Nuln)
- Pursue Artois and the midnight coin; choose to seize, sanctify, or let the luck ride.
