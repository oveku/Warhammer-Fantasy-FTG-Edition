# Session 05 — The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Grand Ball or Last Stand)

Purpose: Bring every thread to a head. Meet Robert “Le Deux,” decide the fate of Satanreux luck, and manage factions in a grand ball that can shift into chaos if Orc pilgrims lay siege and Traditionalist zealots attempt a purge.

Session length: 3–4 hours

Plays differently based on Session 04 outcome:
- If Margot laid to rest: Ballroom calmer; fewer reflection hazards; Traditionalists bolder.
- If Margot bargained as ally: Social boons in the ballroom; skeletal etiquette-enforcers assist; zealots hesitate.
- If Margot empowered: Strong house boons; reflections stronger; nobles nervous; chance of chaos increases.

## Opening — The Masquerade Teeters

- Scene: Spectral-meets-mortal masquerade. Nobles, guilds, clergy of Morr and the Lady, and invited “peasantry with titles.” Orc pilgrims pound on the outer gate chanting for the “Burnt Prophet.” If the party never engaged the Orcs, they arrive now and start a siege drum.
- Read the Room: Three clocks begin ticking (advance them on failures or drama):
	1) Orc Siege (0–3): 0 = campfire songs; 3 = breach and green tide.
	2) Zealot Purge (0–3): 0 = whispers; 3 = full attempt to arrest/destroy the family.
	3) Reflection Strain (0–3): anchors heat up; at 3, mirrors shatter (The Shatter begins).

---

## Structure (Phases)

1) Masks and Introductions (Social Rounds)
- Goal: Secure allies, seed misinformation, or defuse clocks. Work the room in 2–3 rounds.
- Social Targets (examples):
	- Morr Canon (upgrade Chapel aid on success; slows Zealot Purge clock by 1)
	- Traditionalist Canoness (Ysolda): contain rumors; speed or slow Purge clock by 1
	- Guild Taster/Perfumer rival (Colette): trade favors for scent control; adjust Reflection clock by 1
	- Exchequer Agent (Verdoux): promise tax flows; reduce Siege clock by paying guards; or increase if insulted
	- Master Mason (Steinhauer): secure emergency shoring of gate/battlements; −1 Siege if funded

2) The Waltz of Three Deaths (Skill/Puzzle)
- Three dances mirror three “deaths” of Robert (Hergig Burn, Mirror War, Third Death by Reflection). Each dance reveals a mechanic PCs may use later (e.g., timing echo, mirror-swap, burn-purge).
- Perfect Waltz → Vow-Token usable to auto-succeed one etiquette line or to command skeletal servants once.

3) Meeting Le Deux (Roleplay)
- He appears in a mirror first (voice from behind glass), then walks out of an angle of the room as reflections soften. Offer choices and ask questions (“What shall we bind and to whom?”). Chantal’s whisper may intrude.

4) The Shatter (Set Piece)
- Trigger: Any clock hits 3, or PCs force anchor resonance. Mirrors burst; reflections attack; anchor objects hum.
- Mix with Siege/Purge if active: doors slam, Orcs roar, zealots push forward under hawk banners.

## Mechanics — Anchors and Clocks

Anchors in Play (based on prior sessions):
- Lucky Coin: Within earshot of a bell, force a reroll; can dispel a reflection crit when struck on a mirror.
- Perfume Still/Reliquary Core: Spend to force a “memory reveal,” opening an enemy to social or fear tests; risk 1 Corruption.
- Chapel Reliquary Ash: Sanctify a space (1 scene) to impose disadvantage on reflection attacks.

Clock Adjustments (examples):
- Social successes against key targets reduce a chosen clock by 1.
- Assisting the gate with Mason’s crew reduces Siege by 1.
- Using Eau de Morr indiscriminately increases Reflection by 1.
- Insulting clergy increases Purge by 1.

During The Shatter:
- Each round, choose to target an anchor, a clock source (gate, zealot cadre), or the reflection boss.
- Destroying/Consecrating an anchor creates a battlefield effect (e.g., Coin rung on mirror stops reflection crits for 1 round for all).

## Guests and Agendas (Pick 4–6)

- Dame Colette Vervain — Guild Perfumer Rival
	- Wants: Licence to exclusivity in Parravon; discredit Eau de Morr.
	- Offer: “Scent screens” to hide you from reflections for one scene—if you sign her charter.

- Maître Rolf Steinhauer — Master Mason
	- Wants: Contract to shore the château and rebuild the chapel “properly.”
	- Offer: Squad of masons to brace the gate/courtyard now (−1 Siege) for a promise of funds later.

- Étienne Verdoux — Exchequer Agent
	- Wants: Tax assurances; ownership clarity for Satanreux holdings.
	- Threat: Freezes accounts or calls city guard support away unless appeased; or calls them in your favor if convinced.

- Canoness Ysolda — Traditionalist of the Lady
	- Wants: Public repentance/purge; seize anchors “for the Lady.”
	- Offer/Threat: Calls zealots to stand down/up (±1 Purge) based on debate.

- High Adept of Morr (Name at table)
	- Wants: Proper rites; no perfumes.
	- Offer: Joint rite with chapel ash (−1 Reflection; or bind a particular ghost).

- Luc le Rôdeur (if present)
	- Wants: A song that ends with a nosebleed and a legend.
	- Offer: His song can “open” a mirror path once (risky, Random target may swap places).

- Orc Pilgrim Chieftain (Mogdrak’s superior if needed)
	- Wants: Proof the Burnt Prophet wills it.
	- Offer: If appeased with a sign, redirects Waaagh! to attack zealots outside.

## Siege and Purge — If Chaos Erupts

Treat as a montage with 2–3 spotlight actions per PC.

Orc Siege (Stages):
- 1: Drums and challenges; orc envoys demand the Prophet.
- 2: Ram to the gate; skirmish in courtyard if opened.
- 3: Breach; green tide—redirect with a “sign” or hold with masons and sanctified ground.

Zealot Purge (Stages):
- 1: Incense and proclamations; demand surrender of anchors.
- 2: Arrest attempts on Satanreux and PCs; social contest or skirmish.
- 3: Attempt to burn perfumes/chapel; counter with rites or Orc distraction.

Victory Conditions:
- Hold 2 of 3 fronts (Ballroom Reflections, Gate Siege, Zealot Purge) → order restored enough for resolution.
- If all three collapse → last stand evacuation; resolution still possible by ceding an anchor.

## Outcomes (Choose One or Blend)

- Redemption
	- Sanctify chapel; end perfumed luck; Orcs redirected by omen; Robert departs or becomes Warden of the Hollow.
	- Effect: Traditionalists mollified; Guild perfumers grumble; reflection hazards ease in epilogue.

- Damnation
	- Weaponize luck for Parravon; titles and enemies; Orcs proclaim a green crusade in your honor.
	- Effect: Traditionalists become implacable foes; coin/still remain potent; more power, more corruption risk.

- Masked Regent
	- Bind curse into a role; Robert rules “in mirrors”; party keeps one anchor.
	- Effect: Parravon enjoys uncanny prosperity; guests “forget” inconvenient scenes; Wardens of the Hollow mark a PC.

---

## Rewards
- House Writ (political boon): advantage with Parravon bureaucracy for one arc.
- Scent Screen (Colette): negate one detection by reflection or zealot in epilogue scenes.
- Mason’s Bond: call on Rolf’s crew once to fortify or demolish a structure.
- Exchequer Mark: reduce one “Heat” with officials when taxes are concerned.

---

## Epilogue Hooks
- Orc pilgrims seek a new shrine—or trail you for omens.
- Wardens of the Hollow mark a PC without a reflection.
- A minstrel’s song causes polite nosebleeds across Parravon.
- A sealed letter from Bretonnian court arrives: “About your new responsibilities…”
