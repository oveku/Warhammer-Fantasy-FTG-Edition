# 🩸 The House of Le Satanreux

“Blessed be our line — damned enough to make the gods look twice.”  
— Family motto, carved into a cracked mirror above the ancestral hearth of Château Malchance.

## ⚜️ Overview
Originating from Parravon in Bretonnia, the Le Satanreux were minor nobles obsessed with divine favour and personal glory. Their motto, “Luck is a weapon,” was not metaphorical — the family sought to manufacture luck through deals with spirits, hedge-witches, and worse.  
By the time Robert Le Satanreux le Deuxième fled Bretonnia, his family’s fortunes had collapsed into madness, superstition, and whispered heresy.

## 🧛 Robert Le Satanreux le Deuxième
(b. 2497 IC – d. 2521 IC – re-d. 2523 IC – undead present)

Former knight-apprentice turned Grey Order initiate.  
Expelled for “excessive experimentation with resurrection fluids.”

Joined an Imperial adventuring company, The Gilded Graves, where he discovered:  
- His knack for necromancy,  
- His utter inability to tan evenly,  
- And an unsettling charisma among Orc mercenaries (“’e smells like victory and burnt bacon,” they said).

Half his face melted in a warpstone explosion during the Incident at Hergig.  
Later revered as “Da Burnt Prophet” by a band of Black Orcs who thought he was Gork’s cousin.

Encountered demons of Slaanesh during the Mirror War, gaining nightmares, a voice in his head named Chantal, and several unpaid debts.  
Finally killed by his own reflection — and resurrected by an apprentice who misunderstood “Raise morale.”

## 🪦 Notable Relatives (all playable hooks)
### Eléonore Le Satanreux, “The Whisperer”
- Claims to channel the Lady’s “shadow aspect.”
- Lives in a floating barge of bones on the River Stir.
- Offers cryptic prophecies that rhyme too conveniently.
- Keeps ravens that only croak “Not yet.”

### Artois Le Satanreux, “The Brave”
- Runs a gambling den in Nuln under the alias “Sir Arto Brett.”
- Wears fake medals and flirts with witch-hunters’ widows.
- Unknowingly uses Robert’s old spellbook as his account ledger.
- His luck is absurd: bullets jam, cards flip in his favor, but only until midnight.

### Ysabeau Le Satanreux
- Ancestor-spirit who appears during family meals.
- Her perfume can resurrect flowers — or corpses.
- Her descendants still produce it in secret as “Eau de Morr.”

### Margot Le Satanreux, “The Dowager of Dust”
- Undead matriarch.
- Dwells in Château Malchance, now half-submerged in a bog.
- Keeps skeletal servants who speak in perfect etiquette.
- Holds tea parties where the teacups whisper gossip about the guests.

## 🕯️ Rumored Bastards and Curses
- Luc le Rôdeur, a wandering minstrel in Altdorf who claims to be Robert’s son. His songs cause mild nosebleeds.
- The Line of the Left Hand — every third generation, a child is born without a reflection. These children become “Wardens of the Hollow,” destined to guard the family’s luck.
- The Curse of the Lady’s Tear — each family member bears a single drop-shaped birthmark somewhere on their body that burns in the presence of holy relics.
