## Current Campaign: Shadows of the Southwest (FTG Edition)

- Folder: `shadows-of-the-southwest/`
- Length: 4–5 sessions
- Regions: Empire (Altdorf, Nuln) → Bretonnia (Parravon)
- Core Motifs: Coin, corpse-derived perfume, mirrors, “Not yet”
- Anchors: Lucky Coin, Perfume Still (reliquary), Chapel/Relics

### Brief Synopsis

The party is commissioned to travel from the Empire to Parravon to quietly resolve the cursed legacy of House Le Satanreux. Their “manufactured luck” runs on anchors: a midnight-tolling coin, a portable reliquary still that distills Eau de Morr from the dead, and misdirected funerary rites at Château Malchance. Choices about these anchors shape the fate of Parravon and the campaign’s grand ball finale.

### Session Guide (high level)

- Session 01 — The Call to Bretonnia (Empire)
	- Hooks in Altdorf (apothecary incident or Witch Hunter commission), secure passage, face border purity tests. Optional Orc pilgrims foreshadow the “Burnt Prophet.”

- Session 02 — The Lucky Midnight (Nuln)
	- In Sir Arto Brett’s Golden Pike, the midnight bell-ward favors the house until the toll. Expose Artois and decide the fate of the Lucky Coin (anchor).

- Session 03 — Perfumes and Prophecies (River Stir)
	- Confront Eléonore the Whisperer on her bone-barge. Her Eau de Morr is distilled from corpse-derived absolutes. Debate doctrine, then sanctify, steal, or destroy the portable perfume still (anchor). Optional planning aid from Corporal Hansi Unteruber.

- Session 04 — Château Malchance (Parravon)
	- The Dowager’s Waltz, mirror hall, and a mis-consecrated chapel to Morr. Lay the Dowager to rest, bargain, or bind her; position factions for the ball.

- Session 05 — The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Grand Ball)
	- Grand ball or last stand: Orcs may lay siege and zealots attempt a purge. Social rounds, the Waltz of Three Deaths, and The Shatter decide the fate of anchors and Robert “Le Deux.” Choose redemption, damnation, or masked regency.
