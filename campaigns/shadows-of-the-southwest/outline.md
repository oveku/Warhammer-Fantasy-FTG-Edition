# Campaign Outline — Shadows of the Southwest

A border-crossing mystery from Altdorf to Parravon, descending into the cursed legacy of House Le Satanreux.

## Five-Evening Session Plan (Overview)
1) Session 01 — The Call to Bretonnia (Empire)
  - Altdorf hooks: Apothecary Incident (Eau de Morr “Not yet”) or Quiet Commission at the Candle Vault
  - Papers and purity: Brücke-Watch border tests; option to take the Hollow Way; optional Orc “Green Pilgrimage” cameo
  - Motifs seeded: coin, corpse-derived perfume, mirrors, and ravens saying “Not yet”
2) Session 02 — The Lucky Midnight (Nuln)
  - Golden Pike bell-ward: house luck tilts until XII; social rounds on the floor; bravos’ code duel
  - Backroom: coin shrine and ledger heist; decide the fate of the Lucky Coin (anchor)
3) Session 03 — Perfumes and Prophecies (River Stir)
  - Boarding in the fog; Basement Briefing with Corporal Hansi; Reliquary Extraction heist
  - Doctrine debate vs. Eléonore; sanctify, steal, or destroy the corpse-derived perfume still (anchor)
4) Session 04 — Château Malchance (Parravon)
  - Travel: Cross the Parravon Gate (perfumers + clergy), traverse perfumed bog hazards
  - Arrival: Explore Mirror Hall (delayed reflections), Wardrobes of Luck, Chapel of the Wrong God
  - Finale: Choose Practice Waltz (social/puzzle), Mirror Duel (timing skirmish), or Chapel Rite (ritual)
5) Session 05 — The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Parravon)
  - Social: Grand Ball—two to three social rounds to sway clergy, guilds, masons, exchequer
  - Puzzle: The Waltz of Three Deaths reveals usable mechanics
  - Crisis: Clocks—Orc Siege, Zealot Purge, Reflection Strain—may trigger The Shatter
  - Resolution: Redemption, Damnation, or Masked Regent; guest agendas can tilt final state

## Act I — The Call to Bretonnia (Empire → Parravon)
- Inciting Request: A patron (witch hunter, noble factor, or Grey Order mentor) tasks the party with investigating the Satanreux line in Bretonnia. Payment in titles, absolution, or rare tomes.
- Present 1–2 hooks from hooks.md (Quiet Commission, Street Whisper, Bone Wine) to launch travel.
- Obstacles:
  - Bureaucracy: Border writs, letters of passage, and accusations of heresy.
  - Travel Perils: Banditry, Beastmen spoor, and an omen of ravens cawing “Not yet.”
  - Moral Choice: Aid a Bretonnian pilgrim caravan or take a shorter, cursed route.
- Milestone: Secure entry via Brücke-Watch or Hollow Way; audience with customs or chaplain of the Lady.

## Act II — Parravon’s Perfumes and Ghosts
- Investigations split between Nuln’s Golden Pike, Stirland river routes, vintners’ guilds, shrines to the Lady, and ruined Satanreux lands.
- Revelations:
  - Luck is manufactured: tokens, corpse-derived perfumes, and coins imbued with bound spirits.
  - The family’s chapel was accidentally consecrated to Morr; funerary rites misdirected souls to Château Malchance.
  - Eléonore’s “shadow aspect” draws Morr’s attention; she distills memory from the dead and calls it sacrament.
- Set Pieces:
  - The Dowager’s Waltz: a spectral ball at Château Malchance (social combat + exorcism puzzle).
  - The Bone Wine tasting: nobles risk their souls for bouquet and status.
  - River Stir Barge: doctrine debate, reliquary heist, or sanctification; Basement Briefing; optional river chase.
- Milestone: Identify the anchor objects (coin, perfume still, chapel reliquary) and choose which to destroy, redeem, or repurpose.

## Act III — Luck’s Price
- Antagonists converge: Orc pilgrims of “Da Burnt Prophet,” Parravon zealots, and guild enforcers.
- Choices reshape the curse:
  - Sanctify the chapel to Morr, or embrace the Lady’s shadow aspect.
  - Bargain with Margot (power for a promise) or lay her to rest.
  - Decide Robert II’s fate: martyr, monster, or masked regent.
- Set Pieces:
  - Mirror War echoes — a hall of mirrors where reflections attack; only those without reflections can pass freely.
  - The Shatter — at the grand ball, when Siege/Purge/Reflection clocks peak, mirrors burst and anchors resonate.
- Milestone: Cure, contain, or weaponize the Satanreux luck; seat a Masked Regent or sanctify the estate.

## Epilogue — Masks and Mirrors
- Rewards depend on choices: titles in Parravon, enmity of the Lady’s clergy, or a Morr-blessed sanctuary.
- Ongoing Threads: Wardens of the Hollow, Black Orc pilgrimages, and a minstrel whose songs cause nosebleeds.

## Factions and Fronts
- The Cult of Eau de Morr (Eléonore’s apothecary front): profit from luck perfumes.
- Parravon Court Traditionalists: purge heresy, hide noble scandals.
- Orc Pilgrims of the Burnt Prophet: “escort” destiny.
- Guild of Vintners and Tasters: bone wine, bribery, and blackmail.

## Session Pacing
- 4–5 sessions total for this mini-arc; each session includes 1 key confrontation.
- Rotate encounter types: investigation → social → exploration → combat.
- Use fail-forward: wrong choices reveal truths at a price (corruption, scars, obligations).
