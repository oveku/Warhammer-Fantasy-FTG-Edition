# Session 02 — The Lucky Midnight (Nuln)

## Goal
Expose Artois’ role in the Satanreux curse and decide the fate of the Lucky Coin.

## Opening
- Arrive at Sir Arto Brett’s Golden Pike. Midnight tolls reset the room’s luck. Cardsharps whisper about a “coin shrine.”

## Key Scenes
1) Social: Table-hopping inquiry; tempt Artois into boasting.
2) Skill: Cheat the cheaters (Sleight of Hand vs. Perception); or play fair and leverage the midnight reset.
3) Confrontation: Backroom reveal—ledger is Robert’s overwritten spellbook; coin altar hums.

## Combat/Challenge Options
- Duel with Artois’ hired bravos (nonlethal by custom) or a luck-twisted brawl where crits “tilt” to nearest bell.
- Dispel the coin’s aura (ritual) or swap it with a decoy.

## Revelations
- The coin anchors reflections and memories linked to Robert.
- Witch Hunters are circling; someone wants the coin in Parravon.

## Milestone
Obtain, neutralize, or lose the Lucky Coin; gain letters of passage via bribed officials or favors owed.

## Optional Road Interlude: The Green Pilgrimage
Run the orc encounter from encounters.md to foreshadow that Robert still lives.
