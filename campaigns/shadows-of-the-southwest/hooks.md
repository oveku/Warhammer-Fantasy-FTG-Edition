# Adventure Hooks — Shadows of the Southwest

Each hook is presented with setup, complications, and outcomes.

## The Bone Wine
- Setup: A noble banquet in Altdorf plans to debut “Satanreux Reserve,” a cask that ages itself using souls.
- Complications: Guests gain unnatural poise; mirrors fog from the inside; a raven croaks “Not yet.”
- Outcomes: Stop the tasting; switch the cask; or trace the supply back to Parravon (border papers acquired).

## The Lucky Coin
- Setup: In Nuln, Artois’ gambling den thrives under impossible odds. A coin always lands in his favor—until midnight.
- Complications: Witch Hunters sniff heresy; the ledger is a spellbook; midnight resets luck and tempers.
- Outcomes: Win the coin, lose a friend; or learn it anchors Robert’s reflection—drive for Parravon.

## The Dowager’s Waltz
- Setup: Invitations on perfumed vellum arrive: “Celebrate Robert’s third death.” The ball is at Château Malchance.
- Complications: Guests are ghosts; etiquette is binding law; break a dance step, break the truce.
- Outcomes: Lay Margot to rest; bargain for lineage secrets; or become honored dead “for a night.”

## Return of the Burnt Prophet
- Setup: Orc pilgrims request an “escort” for Le Deux. They bring gifts and start fights to honor him.
- Complications: Human authorities panic; pilgrims attract more orcs; omens trend toward green.
- Outcomes: Redirect the Waaagh! with a sign; turn their faith against an enemy; or spark a border crisis.

## Bretonnian Commission
- Setup: A Parravon official hires the PCs to quietly resolve Satanreux scandals.
- Complications: Rival faction wants a public purge; knights test “honor” with duels and riddles of faith.
- Outcomes: Diplomatic visas; strings attached; entry into noble salons and secrets.
