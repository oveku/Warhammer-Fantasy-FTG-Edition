# Encounters — Shadows of the Southwest

## The Green Pilgrimage (Fun Orc Encounter)
- Where: Border Waystation or country road near Parravon
- Tone: Chaotic comedic reverence with real danger if disrespected

### Setup
A chanting line of Orcs and Goblins marches under banners painted with a half-melted human face crowned by a cooking pot. They carry offerings: burnt bacon, cracked mirrors, and candles stuck in helmets. They seek “Da Burnt Prophet” and think the party are his heralds.

### What Orcs Want
- A sign from the Prophet (any omen involving fire, mirrors, or coin flips)
- To “escort” the party safely (and loudly) to the nearest shrine
- To trade: bacon for stories of the Prophet’s miracles

### Skill Challenges (pick 2)
- Intimidate or Command to keep order in the mob (failure causes a friendly brawl)
- Lore (Religion) or Charm to reinterpret the Prophet’s omens toward the party’s goals
- Sleight of Hand to rig a prophetic coin flip without being caught

### Clues that Robert “Le Deux” Lives
- An Orc presents a charred scrap of a Grey Order robe with fresh ash (recent campfire smell)
- A Goblin minstrel hums a refrain that matches Luc le Rôdeur’s tune (nosebleeds ensue)
- A Black Orc shows a polished shield: a human face flickers in the reflection and mouths “Not yet” (only to one PC)

### Outcomes
- Success: Orcs become noisy escorts; reduce random encounters; gain an Orc token (once/session reroll on fear/intimidate vs. Orcs)
- Mixed: Orcs “help” by starting fights with people you needed to impress; gain heat in Parravon
- Failure: A skirmish breaks out (nonlethal unless escalated); still leave a chant: “’E lives, ‘e burns, ‘e laughs at mirrors!”

## Mirror Bandits (Roadside Combat)
- Bandits hired to steal any mirrors carried by the party; they will not look into them. Captured bandit bears a perfume that resurrects flowers.

## Falconer’s Trial (Social/Skill)
- In Parravon, a noble falconer demands proof of “honor” via riddles of wind and mirror; success earns access to flooded archives.
