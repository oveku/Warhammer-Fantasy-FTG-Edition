# Session 03 — Perfumes and Prophecies (River Stir)

## Goal
Confront Eléonore the Whisperer, test her doctrine, and decide the fate of the perfume reliquary.

## Opening
- Track rumors to a fog-shrouded barge stitched from coffin boards. Ravens watch. A ferryman begs for release.

## Key Scenes
1) Social Combat: Debate “the Lady’s shadow aspect” vs. Morr’s rites (use FTG social rules).
2) Investigation: The portable still doubles as a reliquary; mirrored censer skews omens.
3) Confrontation: Eléonore’s attendants chant in meter; dead gather to listen.

## Combat/Challenge Options
- Disrupt the rite (risk calling wrong spirits) or sanctify the deck to Morr.
- Break the mirrored censer to end false omens (shatters into silent smoke).

## Revelations
- Eléonore draws real attention from Morr—she isn’t entirely wrong.
- She hints that Robert laughed at a mirror “last week.”

## Milestone
Claim, consecrate, or destroy the still; free the ferryman; secure safe passage to Parravon with cryptic blessing.
