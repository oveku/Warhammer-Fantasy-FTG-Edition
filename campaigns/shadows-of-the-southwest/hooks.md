## [S01] Quiet Commission to Bretonnia (Witch Hunter Briefing)
- Setup: Witch Hunter Captain Hildegard Falk offers letters of passage, a purse, and a mandate to quietly resolve the Satanreux scandal.
- Complications: A rival Witch Hunter cell wants a public purge; the Candle Vault’s candle labeled “Satanreux — Third Death” won’t stay out.
- Outcomes: Accept for official visas and a Morr token; refuse and rely on forgeries or bribes (adds Heat). Leads to Brücke-Watch Waystation.
- Leads to: Session 01 (border confrontation), Locations: Candle Vault, Brücke-Watch.

## [S01] The Street Whisper (Apothecary Incident)
- Setup: At Maison Satanreux Apothecary, a buyer of Eau de Morr whispers “Not yet” and collapses. The ledger overlays an older spell; a receipt points to Stir Dock 3.
- Complications: Mariette Voss bargains for the party’s protection on a perfume run; Witch Hunters sniff around.
- Outcomes: Gain a vial (one-use boon/temptation) or a delivery chit that leads to Eléonore’s bone barge.
- Leads to: Session 01 → Session 03 (Perfumes & Prophecies), Locations: Apothecary, River Stir barge.

## [S01 Optional] The Green Pilgrimage
- Setup: Orc pilgrims demand a sign from “Da Burnt Prophet.”
- Complications: Loud “escort” angers Bretonnian officials; friendly brawl if mishandled.
- Outcomes: Orc Token boon; rumor that the Prophet laughed at a mirror “last week.”
- Leads to: Foreshadows Sessions 04–05; Encounter: The Green Pilgrimage.

## [S02] The Lucky Midnight (Golden Pike, Nuln)
- Setup: Artois’ den, Sir Arto Brett’s Golden Pike, runs on a midnight rule: a bell-ward tilts luck to the house before XII, then resets at the toll.
- Complications: Witch Hunter widows seek a turn of luck; bravos enforce nonlethal duels; the pit boss “Master of Midnight” times the floor; the ledger in back hums at XII.
- Outcomes: Seize/sanctify/leave the Lucky Coin; gain visas/funds; secure Widow’s Key, Ledger Page, or draw heat from Pike security.
- Leads to: Session 02; Locations: Nuln waterfront & Golden Pike; Encounters: Midnight on the Docks, Golden Pike Floor Events, Ledger Heist, Bravos’ Code Duel.

## [S03] Perfumes and Prophecies (Eléonore’s Barge)
- Setup: Follow Stir Dock 3 deliveries to a bone-barge where Eléonore, an unhinged occult perfumer, preaches the Lady’s “shadow aspect.”
- Complications: Her Eau de Morr is corpse-derived; doctrine debate under a mirrored censer that falsifies omens; a ferryman bound by a resin-sealed coin begs release.
- Outcomes: Claim/consecrate/destroy the portable perfume still (anchor); free the ferryman; gain a Reliquary Core token or a Lot Ysabeau vial; earn cryptic blessing or enmity; optionally meet Corporal Hansi Unteruber for a basement planning session.
- Leads to: Session 03; Locations: River Stir bone barge; Encounter: Perfume Run.

## [S04] The Dowager of Dust (Château Malchance)
- Setup: A perfumed invitation arrives: “Celebrate Robert’s third death.” The château’s ballroom hosts a spectral waltz.
- Complications: Etiquette is law; mirror hall reflects delayed actions; chapel was mis-consecrated to Morr.
- Outcomes: Lay Margot to rest, bargain for lineage secrets, or bind her as an ally for the grand ball.
- Leads to: Session 04; Locations: Château Malchance; Encounter: The Waltzing Dead Cart.

---

## [S05] The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Grand Ball)
- Setup: Mortals and ghosts mingle under truce; factions of the Lady and Morr circle; Orc pilgrims wait outside for a sign.
- Complications: Three dances mirror Robert’s three deaths; reflections attack when anchors resonate (coin, perfume, reliquary).
- Outcomes: Redemption (sanctify), Damnation (weaponize luck), or Masked Regent (bind the curse). Fate of Bretonnia’s scandal sealed.
- Leads to: Session 05; Locations: Château Malchance; payoffs for all anchors.
