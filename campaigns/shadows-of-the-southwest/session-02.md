# Session 02 — The Lucky Midnight (Nuln)

Purpose: Put Artois in the spotlight, expose the Lucky Coin as an anchor, and choose whether to seize, sanctify, or exploit it. Deliver visas or favors to ease the road to Parravon.

Session length: 3–4 hours

Primary beats:
- Stakeout at the docks → entry to the Golden Pike → floor games and social leverage → midnight turn → backroom confrontation → fate of the Coin.

---

## Deep Background (for the GM)

- The Golden Pike’s “midnight rule” is enforced by a hidden bell-ward: within the Pike, luck tilts subtly in Artois’ favor until the toll, then in opponents’ favor for a heartbeat, resetting outcomes. The Lucky Coin resonates to the bell, anchoring reflections and memory fragments of Robert in nearby polished surfaces.
- Witch Hunter widows frequent the Pike to win back seized estates; they loathe Artois but need his odds to “turn” for them. A dock boss keeps the Pike’s side entrance quiet in exchange for debt forgiveness.
- The ledger in Artois’ backroom overlays one of Robert’s old working-books; certain entries can be read as spells under moonlight or during the bell-toll.

Core truth to reveal: The Coin is an anchor that binds chance to ritual time (midnight) and place (the Pike), and it tugs on Robert’s reflected self.

## Key NPCs (Session 02 focus)

1) Artois “the Brave” (alias Sir Arto Brett)
- Role: Gambling-den proprietor; accidental lynchpin of the anchor
- Appearance: Flashy medals, wine-stained smile; confident until the bell tolls
- Motivation: Keep luck flowing; keep danger away; avoid real duels
- Secrets: Coin’s shrine hidden behind a mirrored panel; uses the ledger as an “account” but it hums at midnight

2) “Master of Midnight” (Pit Boss)
- Role: Enforces Pike customs; times games to the bell
- Appearance: Tall, spare, gloved hands; carries a cracked metronome
- Motivation: Keep the house un-burned and profitable
- Secrets: Knows a crawlspace path from floor to bell-rope; will sell it dearly

3) Widow Ilsabet Krauss (Witch Hunter Widow)
- Role: Floor ally or complication
- Appearance: Black lace, old badge under shawl, eagle gaze
- Motivation: Break the Pike’s “cheat” and ruin Artois
- Secrets: Holds a duplicate key to a side door; owes a favor to Captain Falk

4) Johan Pech (Nervous Accountant)
- Role: Numbers man whose “luck” won’t stop; terrified of midnight
- Appearance: Ink-stained, pallid; clutches abacus beads like rosary
- Motivation: Stay alive; balance books that don’t add up before the bell
- Secrets: Knows where the ledger is kept; can be flipped with protection

5) Signet “Velveteen” Sarto (Bravos’ Captain)
- Role: Duel enforcer; prefers showy nonlethal bouts
- Appearance: Velvet half-cape; scar that looks like a club suit
- Motivation: Keep the show merry, avoid actual blood
- Secrets: Afraid of mirrors; will accept a private buyout to look away

## Locations (Golden Pike interior)

1) Main Floor — Fog of Fortune
- Atmosphere: Smoke-hazed chandeliers; dice and cards; bells caged in high rafters
- Features: House tables that “unrig” at midnight; croupiers who clap in patterns as the bell nears
- Clues: Luck noticeably bends toward the house before the bell and away for a breath after

2) The Side Door & Alley
- Atmosphere: Wet stone, bell echo from river towers
- Features: Lock with a temper (picks at −10 unless you have the Widow’s key)
- Clues: Chalk mark “XII” refreshed nightly by a nervous hand

3) The Backroom — Coin Shrine & Ledger
- Atmosphere: Quiet, mirror-backed alcoves; a small altar with a coin under glass
- Features: Mirrored panel that opens on tapping out the bell pattern; ledger shelf
- Clues: Ledger hums at midnight; coin under glass is warm to the touch at eleven

4) Bell Crawlspace
- Atmosphere: Dust; smell of hot iron
- Features: Narrow crawl; view slit to rafters; rope that can be jammed
- Clues: Master of Midnight visits here before the toll

---

## Opening (choose or chain)

1) Midnight on the Nuln Docks (from Encounters)
- Gain free entry marker or a dock boss favor; observe coin behavior at the stroke

2) Pike Entry
- Social: Bribe the doorman, flash a contact’s token (Dock Boss/Widow), or win a “first table” to enter the floor with status

---

## Floor Games & Social Pressure

- Table-Hopping Inquiry: Charm/Gossip (Average) gathers rumors; Great success reveals the mirrored panel rumor
- Cheating the Cheaters: Sleight of Hand vs. Perception; on success, you “catch” a dealer and earn a private with Artois
- Widow’s Gambit: Help Krauss win a hand at eleven fifty-nine to secure her key; fail and she becomes a vocal critic

Midnight Mechanic (Use throughout):
- Ten minutes before midnight, add −10 to players’ luck-based rolls involving the house; at the toll, a single action may reroll once (but reflections in mirrors might flinch/whisper)

---

## Backroom Confrontation (choose path)

1) Duel by Custom (Nonlethal)
- Face Sarto’s bravos; win by flourishes rather than blood; success earns a parley with Artois

2) Ledger Heist (Stealth/Skill)
- Slip in during the toll; the ledger lines rearrange for one minute revealing “mirror-binding” notations; capturing a page grants advantage vs. anchors later

3) Ritual Dispel / Decoy Swap
- Sanctify the coin at the toll (Lore: Religion/Magic + Willpower, Hard); or swap with a decoy using the mirrored panel pattern

Complications:
- If the bell is jammed, the coin overheats; random reflection bleeds out a giggle (“Not yet”), causing fear checks nearby
- If the coin leaves the Pike before the toll, luck “hunts” it—pursuers get inexplicable near-misses chasing the carrier

---

## Outcomes & Branches

- Seize the Coin: Gain the Anchor (Lucky Coin). Boon: once/session force a reroll within earshot of a bell; Cost: mirror anomalies seek you out
- Sanctify the Coin: Break the Pike’s edge; earn Krauss’ lasting favor; Artois becomes an enemy or reluctant informant
- Let Luck Ride: Bargain with Artois for visas, funds, and a letter to Parravon elites; coin remains but you get leverage
- Lose the Coin: A rival cell (or the Master) snatches it; you must track it to Parravon under worse odds

---

## Revelations

- The coin anchors reflections and memory; mirrors may whisper “Not yet” near midnight
- Witch Hunters (or a rival guild) want the coin moved to Parravon for “safekeeping”
- The ledger is a repurposed spellbook linked to Robert’s work; pages act as ritual notes

---

## Rewards

- Letters of Passage (if bargaining succeeds or Falk’s purse is used smartly)
- Widow’s Key (advantage once to bypass a lock, any location tied to the Pike network)
- Ledger Page (single-use advantage to disrupt an anchor interaction)
- The Lucky Coin (Anchor) or its Sanctified Remnant (token that cancels a single reflection-based effect)

---

## Handouts & Props (optional)

- Golden Pike Marker: “Luck smiles within these doors—until the bell.”
- Ledger Fragment: Numbers that become letters at XII; contains “mirror-binding” notation
- Side Door Key: A key wrapped in black lace; faint lily scent

---

## Next: Session 03 — Perfumes and Prophecies (River Stir)
- Follow Dock 3 lead to Eléonore’s bone barge; decide the fate of the portable still (second anchor)
