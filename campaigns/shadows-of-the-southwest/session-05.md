# Session 05 — The Dowager’s Waltz Requiem (Grand Ball)

## Goal
Meet Robert “Le Deux” and resolve the Satanreux luck—cure, contain, or weaponize—while Parravon watches.

## Opening
- A spectral-meets-mortal masquerade. Nobles, ghosts, Orc pilgrims at the door, and clergy of the Lady and Morr in uneasy truce.

## Structure (Phases)
1) Masks and Introductions (Social): Secure allies (Morr priest, Guild Taster, or a Traditionalist).
2) The Waltz of Three Deaths (Skill/Puzzle): Three dances mirror three deaths of Robert; each reveals a mechanic.
3) Meeting Le Deux (Roleplay): He appears in a mirror first, then in flesh—or something close to it.
4) The Shatter (Combat/Set Piece): Reflections attack; anchor objects resonate (coin, perfume still, reliquary).

## Mechanics
- Use social combat to sway factions; each success grants boons in the set piece.
- During combat, PCs can target anchors to change the fight (e.g., coin to dispel reflection crits).

## Outcomes (Choose One or Mix)
- Redemption: Sanctify chapel; end the perfumed luck; Robert departs or becomes Warden of the Hollow.
- Damnation: Weaponize luck for Parravon; gain titles and enemies; Orcs proclaim a green crusade.
- Masked Regent: Bind curse into a role; Robert rules in mirrors; party keeps one anchor as key.

## Epilogue Hooks
- Orc pilgrims seek a new shrine.
- The Wardens of the Hollow mark a PC without a reflection.
- A minstrel’s song causes polite nosebleeds across Parravon.
