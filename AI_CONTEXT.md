## üìã Project Overview

### What is This Project?

This is the **Warhammer Fantasy FTG Edition** - a heavily modified version of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) with extensive house rules. "FTG" stands for our gaming group's custom modifications that emphasize:

- **Narrative-driven gameplay** over pure mechanics
- **Balanced but dangerous combat** where players feel heroic but threatened
- **Streamlined rules** that reduce bookkeeping
- **Enhanced magic system** with more flexibility and risk
- **Deep roleplaying opportunities** with social and political intrigue

### Setting

The game is set in the **Warhammer Fantasy Old World**, specifically:
- **Primary Location:** The Empire (Reikland, Middenland, and surrounding provinces)
- **Tone:** Grimdark fantasy with moments of dark humor
- **Themes:** Corruption, moral ambiguity, survival against overwhelming odds, political intrigue
- **Time Period:** Early 2500s IC (Imperial Calendar), before the End Times

## üé≤ Core House Rules Summary

### Character Creation & Advancement

**Modified Career System:**
- Players have more flexibility to customize careers
- Can "multiclass" by taking talents from adjacent careers
- Advancement is milestone-based rather than purely XP-driven
- Starting characters are slightly more competent than standard WFRP (Tier 2 equivalent)

**Attribute System:**
- Uses percentile system (d100) like standard WFRP
- Starting attributes are slightly higher (baseline +5 to +10)
- Critical successes on doubles (11, 22, 33, etc.)
- Critical failures on matching tens/ones (00, 99 only)

**Fate and Resilience:**
- Fate points are precious and regenerate slowly (one per major story arc)
- Resilience points can be spent to reduce damage or resist corruption
- Added "Grit" system: temporary resilience that recharges between sessions

### Combat System

**Action Economy:**
- Simplified action system: Move + Action OR Full Round Action
- Reactions are automatic if you have the skill/talent
- Initiative uses tens digit of Agility + d10 (faster resolution)

**Damage and Wounds:**
- Damage is more lethal but players have more defensive options
- "Bloodied" state at half wounds: grants desperation bonuses
- Death at 0 wounds requires immediate medical attention
- Negative wounds = dying, with Constitution checks each round

**Critical Hits:**
- Streamlined critical hit tables (less instant death)
- More focus on dramatic wounds and lasting consequences
- "Battle Scars" system for permanent but interesting injuries

**Combat Tactics:**
- Emphasis on positioning, cover, and terrain
- Flanking bonuses (+20% to hit)
- Combat maneuvers encouraged (disarm, trip, etc.)

### Magic System

**Channeling & Casting:**
- Casting uses Willpower test (unchanged)
- **Modified Miscast Rules:** More gradual corruption and interesting effects
- Spellcasters can "push" spells for extra power at increased risk
- Ritual magic is more accessible but time-consuming and dangerous

**Arcane Lores:**
- All core lores available plus custom lores:
  - **Lore of Blood** (modified for PCs)
  - **Lore of Shadows** (expanded)
  - **Lore of the Wild** (custom naturalistic magic)

**Corruption & Mutation:**
- Corruption accumulates slowly from magic use
- Clear corruption tracks with narrative consequences
- Mutations can be hidden initially but become problematic
- Redemption is possible but difficult

### Social & Intrigue

**Social Combat:**
- Formal system for debates, negotiations, and manipulation
- Uses Charm, Intimidate, Bluff, and Intuition skills
- Political standing affects social encounters
- Reputation system tracks fame and infamy

**Downtime Activities:**
- Between sessions, players can pursue personal projects
- Business ventures, research, crafting, or political maneuvering
- Generates plot hooks and personal investment
